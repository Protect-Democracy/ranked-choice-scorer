# Protect Democracy Open Source Code of Conduct

## Introduction

[Protect Democracy](https://protectdemocracy.org) is committed to 
building a safe, welcoming, harassment-free culture for everyone. We do not merely want an 
environment that is free from hostility, we want one that is actively welcoming and inclusive. We 
want our team, our workplace culture, and our open source community to reflect and celebrate the 
diversity of the people we serve.

This Code of Conduct summarizes federal anti-harassment law and Protect Democracy policy. 

## Scope

We expect everyone on the Protect Democracy team, and those contributing to our open source community, to exhibit 
these behaviors and abide by applicable federal laws and Protect Democracy policies. In addition, we expect 
everyone within Protect Democracy spaces to exhibit these behaviors and refrain from behavior prohibited by 
anti-harassment laws and federal policies on harassment. These spaces include:

- Protect Democracy’s physical offices
- Protect Democracy events and meetings
- All of Protect Democracy’s online forums and virtual collaboration tools, including code repositories


## What we strive for

At the Protect Democracy, we strive to create a welcoming and inclusive culture that empowers people to best protect 
the financial interests of all consumers. That kind of atmosphere requires an open exchange of ideas 
balanced by thoughtful guidelines. Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment 
for our open source community include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
- Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community and public

## Unacceptable behavior

To help understand the kinds of behaviors that are illegal or run counter to the culture we seek to 
foster, we've listed some actions below that violate federal law and Protect Democracy policy. We've also included 
steps to take if you encounter behavior that runs contrary to this policy.

The Protect Democracy Policy Statement on Equal Employment Opportunity and Workplace Harassment forbids 
discrimination or harassment based on:

- Race
- Color
- Religion
- Sex (including pregnancy, sexual orientation, transgender status, gender identity or expression, gender non-conformity, or sex stereotyping of any kind)
- National origin
- Disability
- Age (40 years or older)
- Genetic information
- Parental status
- Political affiliation
- Marital status
- Uniformed status
- Membership in a labor organization or union activities
- Prior equal employment opportunity (EEO) or whistleblower activity
- Any other factor unrelated to your merit

The policy also forbids harassing conduct, which includes unwelcome conduct based on any (or a combination of) protected traits or characteristics. Such conduct may take the form of any of the following: 

- Offensive jokes, comments, objects, or pictures 
- Questions about a person’s identity (e.g., disability status, gender identity, sexual orientation, national origin, etc.) 
- Undue attention
